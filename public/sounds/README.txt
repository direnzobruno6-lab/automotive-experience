PLEASE READ: Engine Audio Setup
===================================
To ensure maximum accuracy for the engine sounds, please place your verified .mp3 files in this directory (`public/sounds/`).

The system expects the following filenames (based on the Engine Type):

1.  `inline4.mp3`  (for Inline-4)
2.  `inline6.mp3`  (for Inline-6)
3.  `v6.mp3`       (for V6)
4.  `boxer.mp3`    (for Boxer)
5.  `v8.mp3`       (for V8)
6.  `v10.mp3`      (for V10)
7.  `v12.mp3`      (for V12)
8.  `w16.mp3`      (for W16)

Once these files are present, clicking the engine card on the website will play the sound automatically!
